# IL2CPP Android Template

This project is based on [LGL Mod Menu](https://github.com/LGLTeam/Android-Mod-Menu/). Since the original project is no longer actively maintained, I have made several modifications, including:

- **UI Changes**: Updated the menu interface.
- **New Modules**: Added additional modules to extend functionality.
- **Obfuscation**:
  - Integrated [BlackObfuscator](https://github.com/CodingGay/BlackObfuscator-ASPlugin) for enhanced code obfuscation.
  - Added [LSParanoid](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSParanoid) to provide string encryption for securing sensitive text data.

## How to use
To enable and display a floating menu in your target app, follow these steps:

#### 1. Request Permission for Floating Menu
To allow your target app to draw a floating menu overlay on top of other apps, add the following permission to your AndroidManifest.xml file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW" />
```

This permission is required for overlaying UI elements, such as a floating menu, across other applications.

#### 2. Register the Service to Show the Menu
To activate the floating menu, declare a service in `AndroidManifest.xml` to your targer app. This service will handle the display and lifecycle of the floating menu:

```xml
<service android:name="com.android.support.Launcher" android:enabled="true" android:exported="true" android:stopWithTask="true" />
```

#### 3. Call the Loader class
To integrate and initialize the floating menu loader, add the following code in the `onCreate` method within `UnityPlayerActivity.smali`. If your target app uses a custom launcher activity, locate it in `AndroidManifest.xml` and insert the code in that activityâ€™s `onCreate` method instead.

```smali
invoke-static {p0}, Lcom/android/support/Loader;->Start(Landroid/content/Context;)V
```

If you prefer not to use `Remap` , simply call this method:
```smali
invoke-static {p0}, Lcom/android/support/Main;->Start(Landroid/content/Context;)V
```
